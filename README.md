# Exploring Financial Data using Nasdaq Data Link API
The [Nasdaq Data Link API](https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/docs/in-depth-usage-1) provides access to a diverse variety of financial data sets, including detailed metrics on numerous corporations. We'll look at the MER/F1 datatable, which includes detailed financial information like balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements.

We will extract financial data for a certain collection of companies in order to better understand their long-term financial success. We'll look at measures like Accrued Expenses Turnover and see how these values change between organizations and geographies.

Our goal is to do a complete study of this financial data, including trend analysis and comparison studies. We will use Python for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, as well as build visualizations to effectively explain our findings.
